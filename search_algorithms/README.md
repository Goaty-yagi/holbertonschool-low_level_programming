# C Search Algorithms

This C program provides implementations of common search algorithms. These algorithms are designed to efficiently locate a specific element within a dataset. The goal is to showcase different search strategies and help you understand their time and space complexities.

## Contents

1. **Linear Search:**
   - Simple search algorithm that iterates through the dataset to find the target element.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - Efficient search algorithm for sorted datasets. Utilizes the divide-and-conquer strategy.

3. **space complexity:**
   - It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the additional memory it needs to execute based on the size of the input.
